best man rises project 
Young Brad was walking on the streets. While walking he was thinking about Batman. It
was a dark rainy night when he suddenly saw a bat flying.
He remembered his fear of bats and got an idea. He decided that he will be disguised and
call himself BestMan.
Brad wants you to portray his dark rainy night, so he can keep it as a reminder of the day
when he decided to become BestMan!
